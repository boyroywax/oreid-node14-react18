## Prepare Your Project

```text
ðŸ“¢  What this article covers:  Starting with ORE ID from scratch.
```

This article will cover the setup and preparation of your project.  It will explain the tools needed to implement ORE ID into a React App.

Setting up your development environment is an important first step to working with ORE ID.

### Recommended Tools:

- NodeJS v16 or above
- React v6 or above
- Yarn
- Visual Studio
- git

### Creating an ORE ID Application

ORE ID can be easily added to a new create-react-app project or a custom React application.  

But, first you must sign up for a developerâ€™s account at [https://oreid.io/developer](https://oreid.io/developer).  Simply follow the [developer dashboard instructions](https://www.notion.so/Developer-Dashboard-e8828eec687e4e9bbd4673582f79542b).  

You will need your applicationâ€™s *appId* to interact with the ORE ID service.  The *appId* can be found under the *settings* section of the developer dashboard.  You may also need to pay attention to your applicationâ€™s [funding account](https://www.notion.so/Funding-Account-60441b1822c94b89b10ab3987ab53074), authentication providers, and [action whitelist](https://www.notion.so/Whitelisting-blockchain-actions-9027fd7f7e3e4463b9fd13dfaf06f59e) (These topics will be addressed later). 

### Start with create-react-app

A new create-react-app was used as the starting point of this article series.  The React app was generated by using the *npx* program.

```bash
npx create-react-app oreid
```

### Adding ORE ID into your current React application

OreId-js can be easily implemented into active projects.  If you are starting off from this point, the following articles can be used as a working example.  Although, they may not reflect your actual integration experience.  If you are having any issues, kindly drop us a ticket at [https://support.aikon.com](https://support.aikon.com).

### Grab the sample React application
